# Example of adding the markers dynamically in the Syncfusion Blazor Maps component.
In this Blazor MAUI project, we created a sample to demonstrate how to add the markers dynamically in the Blazor Maps.

In this sample project, we can declare the marker data source as a **ObservableCollection** data type instead of **List** data type. A button "Add Marker" is available to add the markers to the collection. When the data is pushed into the collection during the button click event, a new markers are dynamically added to the Maps component.
