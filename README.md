# Example of adding the markers dynamically in the Syncfusion Blazor Maps component.
In this Blazor MAUI project, we created a sample to demonstrate how to add the markers dynamically in the Blazor Maps.

In this sample project, we can declare the marker data source as a **ObservableCollection** data type instead of **List** data type. A button **Add Marker** is available to add the markers to the collection. Initially, we added two markers above the OSM map. When clicking the button, an additional three markers are dynamically added to the Maps component.
