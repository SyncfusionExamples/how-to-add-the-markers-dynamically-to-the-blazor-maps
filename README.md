# Example of adding the markers dynamically in the Syncfusion Blazor Maps component.
In this Blazor MAUI project, we created an example to show how to dynamically add markers to Blazor Maps.

In this example, we have a marker data source as an **ObservableCollection** data type, two objects, and a button **Add Marker** to add the marker dynamically. These markers appear above OpenStreetMap. When you click the button, three objectsÂ are added to the marker data source, resulting in the addition of three markers to the Maps component. Maps will automatically refresh when the marker data source is updated.
